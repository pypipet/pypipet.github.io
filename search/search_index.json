Introduction \u00b6 PyPipet is an open source project, aiming to integrate data flows of Ecommerce. It is a light solution of Ecommerce Dataflow Management . It provides platform-independent data flows to support Ecommerce functionality. It simplifies data pipelines of data management in ecommerce, for example, adding catalog, updating product, managing inventory and orders, etc. It is specially customized for small business who are selling on wordpress (for example, with woocommerce), shopify, ebay, etc. (more frontshop connected will be added). It extremely handy if the business is selling on multiple platforms (e.g., for dropshipping). It makes it extreamly easy to move your frontshop from one platform to anothor.
